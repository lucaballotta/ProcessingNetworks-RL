# ProcessingNetworks-RL
Code for simulations in CDC paper "A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Sensing Design in Resource-Constrained Wireless Networked Control Systems" by L. Ballotta, G. Peserico, and F. Zanini (folder "CDC paper") and in preprint "To Compute or not to Compute? Adaptive Smart Sensing in Resource-Constrained Edge Computing" by L. Ballotta, G. Peserico, F. Zanini, and P. Dini (folder "Journal paper").

## How to run
CDC paper: To test and plot behavior of pre-trained and custom policies,
run _test_custom_policies_ and _compare_policies_.

Journal paper:
- Homogeneous sensors: same as CDC paper

To train a Q-learnig policy with new data,
run _qlearning_.

Training data are automatically saved in the folder "experiments".
